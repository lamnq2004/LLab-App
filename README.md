# LLab-App
The LLab Customer App is designed to streamline the order management experience for customers. Serving as a user-centric interface, the primary functionalities include the ability to view and manage orders seamlessly and to receive pertinent notifications directly within the app. The app's architecture leverages Firebase as its underlying database, ensuring real-time data synchronization, scalability, and robustness. This choice aligns to achieve the Custom App Level 2. The preliminary UI design using Figma, underscores an intuitive and responsive user experience, ensuring that customers have a seamless journey from order placement to delivery updates.

The LLab Customer App further enriches its order management capabilities through its robust CRUD functionality, ensuring a holistic approach to order handling:
- Create (C): Empowering customers to effortlessly initiate new orders. With a few simple clicks, users can input the necessary details, making order placement both swift and straightforward.
- Read (R): Customers can conveniently view their order details straight from the database. This means whether they have just placed an order or are checking the status of a previous one.
- Update (U): Recognizing that requirements can change, the app provides the flexibility to modify order details post-submission. 
- Delete (D): If there's ever a need to cancel an order, the 'Delete' feature ensures that this process is as simple as creating one. With user confirmation, orders can be removed.

Incorporating these CRUD functionalities into the LLab App not only ensures efficient order management but also enhances user autonomy, granting customers full control over their orders from initiation to finalization.
